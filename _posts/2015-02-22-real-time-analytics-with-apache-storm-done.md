And [Real-Time Analytics with Apache Storm](https://www.udacity.com/course/ud381) it's over. Kinda. But it has been a fun road to travel.

<!-- more -->

When I say 'kinda' is because the last lesson consists on a relatively big project (classifying tweets) which I will skip. It can be quite time consuming and I feel after the previous lessons I understand the concepts behind Storm well enough. I believe that, even if I spend now a few evenings doing this project, I will forget stuff from lack of use of Storm after it. Thus, it feels a better investment of my time to focus on other areas right now and put that effort whenever I need to use Storm for something.

That said, the course was very useful. I liked the format, and it gave me a good library of examples I stored in [Github](https://github.com/pvillega/udacity-storm) and can be used in the future to refresh my memory. A tip: if you do the course, don't skip the interviews at the end of lesson 4. They have some nice insights.
