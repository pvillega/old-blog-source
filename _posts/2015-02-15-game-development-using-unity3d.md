I think that most software developers have a secret desire: to build their own game. Unfortunately the golden times of the 80's where simplistic games with almost no graphics succeeded are gone. Music, graphics, story... nowadays a decent game requires lots of manpower. But is that dream over?

<!-- more -->

Fortunately technology advances fast. Very fast. If the complexity of games has increased, so has the capabilities of game development tools. For example, [Unity3D](http://unity3d.com/), a game engine used by [plenty](http://unity3d.com/showcase/gallery) of successful games that streamlines the process to a huge degree. No, a single developer won't build the next [Clash of Clans](http://clashofclans.com/) but it's much easier for a small team to do so. 

I tried Unity a few years ago (when Unity 3.x was offered for free) but, somehow, I never spent much time to it. I forgot about it until recently, when I ended up with a link to a [very good tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLREdURb87ks2qkD9svvlIwYwN35FZ3Afv&app=desktop) (warning: it's in Spanish) and I decided I'd implement something by following it.

And, indeed, I did. I started yesterday morning and in less than 48 hours my game is [available](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.araconsoftware.rundemo) in the Google Play store. Granted: it's buggy, not original and very silly. But I built it, so I'll overlook all those truths for a while if you don't mind me doing so. It's my baby-game ;)

I also uploaded the source to [Github](https://github.com/pvillega/run-unity3d-game-sample). I deviated a bit from the tutorial (nothing major), so feel free to use it as a template to experiment with. 

Does this mean I'll drop everything and become a game developer? Not really. But I may start devoting more time doing things like this, as it was extremely fun. Maybe after I finish with the Machine Learning courses, and testing Akka Http, and Akka Streams, and... well, you get the idea ;)
